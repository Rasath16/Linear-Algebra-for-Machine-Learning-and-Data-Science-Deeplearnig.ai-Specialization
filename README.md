# Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science – Linear Algebra  

This repository contains my **handwritten notes, slides, and Python notebooks** from the **Linear Algebra** course in the *Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization* by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/).  

The goal of this repo is to **share resources** and help others strengthen their math foundation for **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

## 📘 Course Overview  
The Linear Algebra course covers the fundamental concepts required to understand and implement modern ML/AI algorithms.  
Key topics include:  
- Vectors and vector spaces  
- Matrix operations and transformations  
- Span, basis, and linear independence  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
- Orthogonality and projections  
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA

## 🔗 Next Steps  
This repo is the **first milestone**.  
In the coming weeks, I will complete and share notes + notebooks for the other two courses in the specialization:  
- **Calculus**  
- **Probability & Statistics**  

Stay tuned 🚀
